If no argument is provided, output usage guidance and exit without spawning any agents:
> Usage: `$team-audio [feature or area]` — specify the feature or area to design audio for (e.g., `combat`, `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`). Do not ask the user directly here; output the guidance directly.

When this skill is invoked with an argument, orchestrate the audio team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** Proceed through phases autonomously. Record each phase's
decision and the alternatives rejected in the final report; stop only on K1/K2
or a gate exit 2 (`rules/autonomy-contract.md`).

1. **Read the argument** for the target feature or area (e.g., `combat`,
   `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`).

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read relevant design docs in `design/gdd/` for the feature
   - Read the sound bible at `design/gdd/sound-bible.md` if it exists
   - Read existing audio asset lists in `assets/audio/`
   - Read any existing sound design docs for this area

## How to Delegate

Use the Codex subagent mechanism to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: audio-director` — Sonic identity, emotional tone, audio palette
- `subagent_type: sound-designer` — SFX specifications, audio events, mixing groups
- `subagent_type: technical-artist` — Audio middleware, bus structure, memory budgets
- `subagent_type: [primary engine specialist]` — Validate audio integration patterns for the engine
- `subagent_type: gameplay-programmer` — Audio manager, gameplay triggers, adaptive music

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (feature description, existing audio assets, design doc references).

3. **Orchestrate the audio team** in sequence:

### Step 1: Audio Direction (audio-director)
Spawn the `audio-director` agent to:
- Define the sonic identity for this feature/area
- Specify the emotional tone and audio palette
- Set music direction (adaptive layers, stems, transitions)
- Define audio priorities and mix targets
- Establish any adaptive audio rules (combat intensity, exploration, tension)

### Step 2: Sound Design and Audio Accessibility (parallel)
Spawn the `sound-designer` agent to:
- Create detailed SFX specifications for every audio event
- Define sound categories (ambient, UI, gameplay, music, dialogue)
- Specify per-sound parameters (volume range, pitch variation, attenuation)
- Plan audio event list with trigger conditions
- Define mixing groups and ducking rules

Spawn the `accessibility-specialist` agent in parallel to:
- Identify which audio events carry critical gameplay information (damage received, enemy nearby, objective complete) and require visual alternatives for hearing-impaired players
- Specify subtitle requirements: which audio events need captions, what text format, on-screen duration
- Check that no gameplay state is communicated by audio alone (all must have a visual fallback)
- Review the audio event list for any that could cause issues for players with auditory sensitivities (high-frequency alerts, sudden loud events)
- Output: audio accessibility requirements list integrated into the audio event spec

### Step 3: Technical Implementation (parallel)
Spawn the `technical-artist` agent to:
- Design the audio middleware integration (Wwise/FMOD/native)
- Define audio bus structure and routing
- Specify memory budgets for audio assets per platform
- Plan streaming vs preloaded asset strategy
- Design any audio-reactive visual effects

Spawn the **primary engine specialist** in parallel (from `.codex/studio/technical-preferences.md` Engine Specialists) to validate the integration approach:
- Is the proposed audio middleware integration idiomatic for the engine? (e.g., Godot's built-in AudioStreamPlayer vs FMOD, Unity's Audio Mixer vs Wwise, Unreal's MetaSounds vs FMOD)
- Any engine-specific audio node/component patterns that should be used?
- Known audio system changes in the pinned engine version that affect the integration plan?
- Output: engine audio integration notes to merge with the technical-artist's plan

If no engine is configured, skip the specialist spawn.

### Step 4: Code Integration (gameplay-programmer)
Spawn the `gameplay-programmer` agent to:
- Implement audio manager system or review existing
- Wire up audio events to gameplay triggers
- Implement adaptive music system (if specified)
- Set up audio occlusion/reverb zones
- Write unit tests for audio event triggers

4. **Compile the audio design document** combining all team outputs.

5. **Save to** `design/gdd/audio-[feature].md`.

6. **Output a summary** with: audio event count, estimated asset count,
   implementation tasks, and any open questions between team members.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — audio design document produced and team pipeline finished.

If the pipeline stops on K1/K2 (e.g., the feature's GDD is missing and no skill in the repo produces it, or a critical accessibility gap the team cannot design around):

Verdict: **BLOCKED** — [reason]

## File Write Protocol

All file writes (audio design docs, SFX specs, implementation files) are
delegated to sub-agents spawned as a Codex subagent. This orchestrator does not
write files directly. Each sub-agent writes only within its owned paths
(`rules/subagent-collaboration.md` § 3) and returns the paths written; list
every path with its revert command (`git checkout -- <path>`) in the final
report.

## Next Steps

- Review the audio design doc with the audio-director before implementation begins.
- Use `$dev-story` to implement the audio manager and event system once the design is approved.
- Run `$asset-audit` after audio assets are created to verify naming and format compliance.

## Error Recovery Protocol

If any spawned agent (as a Codex subagent) returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete:

1. **Record it**: "[AgentName]: BLOCKED — [reason]" and the phase it interrupted, in the final report
2. **Choose the narrowest recovery yourself and report it**: retry with narrower scope, or skip the agent and note the gap
3. **BLOCKED only when the missing output is required by a later phase and cannot be reproduced** (K1/K2). Name what is needed to resume
4. **Always produce a partial report** — output whatever was completed. Never discard work because one agent blocked.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; run `$architecture-decision` first
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `$create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess
