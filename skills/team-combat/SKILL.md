name: team-combat
description: "Orchestrate the combat team: coordinates game-designer, gameplay-programmer, ai-programmer, technical-artist, sound-designer, and qa-tester to design, implement, and validate a combat feature end-to-end."
---
**Argument check:** If no combat feature description is provided, output:
> "Usage: `$team-combat [combat feature description]` — Provide a description of the combat feature to design and implement (e.g., `melee parry system`, `ranged weapon spread`)."
Then stop immediately without spawning any subagents or reading any files.

When this skill is invoked with a valid argument, orchestrate the combat team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** Proceed through phases autonomously. Record each phase's
decision and the alternatives rejected in the final report; stop only on K1/K2
or a gate exit 2 (`rules/autonomy-contract.md`).

## Team Composition
- **game-designer** — Design the mechanic, define formulas and edge cases
- **gameplay-programmer** — Implement the core gameplay code
- **ai-programmer** — Implement NPC/enemy AI behavior for the feature
- **technical-artist** — Create VFX, shader effects, and visual feedback
- **sound-designer** — Define audio events, impact sounds, and ambient combat audio
- **engine specialist** (primary) — Validate architecture and implementation patterns are idiomatic for the engine (read from `.codex/studio/technical-preferences.md` Engine Specialists section)
- **qa-tester** — Write test cases and validate the implementation

## How to Delegate

Use the Codex subagent mechanism to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: game-designer` — Design the mechanic, define formulas and edge cases
- `subagent_type: gameplay-programmer` — Implement the core gameplay code
- `subagent_type: ai-programmer` — Implement NPC/enemy AI behavior
- `subagent_type: technical-artist` — Create VFX, shader effects, visual feedback
- `subagent_type: sound-designer` — Define audio events, impact sounds, ambient audio
- `subagent_type: [primary engine specialist]` — Engine idiom validation for architecture and implementation
- `subagent_type: qa-tester` — Write test cases and validate implementation

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (design doc path, relevant code files, constraints). Launch independent agents in parallel where the pipeline allows it (e.g., Phase 3 agents can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1: Design
Delegate to **game-designer**:
- Create or update the design document in `design/gdd/` covering: mechanic overview, player fantasy, detailed rules, formulas with variable definitions, edge cases, dependencies, tuning knobs with safe ranges, and acceptance criteria
- Output: completed design document

### Phase 2: Architecture
Delegate to **gameplay-programmer** (with **ai-programmer** if AI is involved):
- Review the design document
- Design the code architecture: class structure, interfaces, data flow
- Identify integration points with existing systems
- Output: architecture sketch with file list and interface definitions

Then spawn the **primary engine specialist** to validate the proposed architecture:
- Is the class/node/component structure idiomatic for the pinned engine? (e.g., Godot node hierarchy, Unity MonoBehaviour vs DOTS, Unreal Actor/Component design)
- Are there engine-native systems that should be used instead of custom implementations?
- Any proposed APIs that are deprecated or changed in the pinned engine version?
- Output: engine architecture notes — incorporate into the architecture before Phase 3 begins

### Phase 3: Implementation (parallel where possible)
Delegate in parallel:
- **gameplay-programmer**: Implement core combat mechanic code
- **ai-programmer**: Implement AI behaviors (if the feature involves NPC reactions)
- **technical-artist**: Create VFX and shader effects
- **sound-designer**: Define audio event list and mixing notes

### Phase 4: Integration
- Wire together gameplay code, AI, VFX, and audio
- Ensure all tuning knobs are exposed and data-driven
- Verify the feature works with existing combat systems

### Phase 5: Validation
Delegate to **qa-tester**:
- Write test cases from the acceptance criteria
- Test all edge cases documented in the design
- Verify performance impact is within budget
- File bug reports for any issues found

### Phase 6: Sign-off
- Collect results from all team members
- Report feature status: COMPLETE / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED
- List any outstanding issues and their assigned owners

## Error Recovery Protocol

If any spawned agent (as a Codex subagent) returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete:

1. **Record it**: "[AgentName]: BLOCKED — [reason]" and the phase it interrupted, in the final report
2. **Choose the narrowest recovery yourself and report it**: retry with narrower scope, or skip the agent and note the gap
3. **BLOCKED only when the missing output is required by a later phase and cannot be reproduced** (K1/K2). Name what is needed to resume
4. **Always produce a partial report** — output whatever was completed. Never discard work because one agent blocked.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; run `$architecture-decision` first
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `$create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess

## File Write Protocol

All file writes (design documents, implementation files, test cases) are
delegated to sub-agents spawned as a Codex subagent. This orchestrator does not
write files directly. Each sub-agent writes only within its owned paths
(`rules/subagent-collaboration.md` § 3) and returns the paths written; list
every path with its revert command (`git checkout -- <path>`) in the final
report.

## Output

A summary report covering: design completion status, implementation status per team member, test results, and any open issues.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — combat feature designed, implemented, and validated.
Verdict: **BLOCKED** — one or more phases could not complete; partial report produced with unresolved items listed.

## Next Steps

- Run `$code-review` on the implemented combat code before closing stories.
- Run `$balance-check` to validate combat formulas and tuning values.
- Run `$team-polish` if VFX, audio, or performance polish is needed.
